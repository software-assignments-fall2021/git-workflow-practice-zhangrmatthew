## Article Summary
This article talks about how a **ransomware attack** rendered a lot of technology
at a hospital to be unusable. As a result, a baby suffered a preventable issue
at childbirth due to lack of monitoring of signals, which the baby later died
from. The parent is now suing the hospital, and if successful, this would be
the first confirmed death from ransomware. This highlights the increasing
importance that **cybersecurity** has on our daily lives.


## Comment
This showcases just how important cybersercurity is for instutions that affect hundreds or thousands of lives daily, like hospitals. I'm reminded of an article from just over a year ago that said that over 83% of the us healthcare system is running outdated software vulnerable to attacks, including 56% of hospitals using Windows 7. Hopefully this has improved significantly during the year from when the article was written.
